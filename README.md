# Kolide_Fleet
Use web version of Kolide Fleet
Click on "Add Device"
Download the appropriate file for each OS (Windows/Linux)

Since my demo is on a virtual machine, I used a shared folder to import the file. During real-world application, use a thumb drive to import file. Running the file will automatically add device to Kolide.
